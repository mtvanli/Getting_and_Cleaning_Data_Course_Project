## About the R script


The run_analysis.R script reads data from the "Human Activity Recognition 
Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0" and produces a new tidy dataset 
which may be used for further analysis.

The data in the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset 
Version 1.0" have been taken from experiments carried out with a group of 30 
volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, 
SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, 3-axial linear acceleration and 
3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz data were captured. 
The experiments were video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset was randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data 
and 30% the test data.

The original dataset included the following data files:

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': List of class labels and their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'train/subject_train.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

'test/subject_test.txt': ID's of subjects in the training data
